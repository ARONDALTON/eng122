General
=======

- Please log your weekly hours in a spreadsheet in the google drive directory.
- We will have a 1 hour weekly instructor meeting to go over the homework, the
  discussion section activities, etc.

Lectures
========

You are not required to attend any of the lecture periods. You are welcome to
sit in on lectures or even give some yourself. If you sit in on the lectures I
will ask you to note feedback for me. If you would like to give a lecture, just
let me know and we will set something up.

Office Hours
============

You will be expected to hold two 1 hr office hours each week. These should be
convenient for the homework due dates and not conflict with Jason's office
hours. Past TAs have used Bainer 2071 for the office hours. Provide feedback to
Jason about how well these are attended so that we can adjust if needed.

Websites
========

Course Website
--------------

All of the public information about the course should go on this website. The
website source is at https://github.com/moorepants/eme122. You'll need to make
a Github account and share your user name with Jason to get access to modify
the website.

Canvas
------

Canvas will be used for all of the private information related to the course
that is shared with the students, e.g. grades, copyrighted materials,
announcements, roster, email lists, solutions, etc.

Piazza
------

Students should be directed to piazza to ask asyncronous questions
electronically (instead of email). Any question that could benefit more than
one student should be asked here, so if student email you directly, kindly
direct them to Piazza. It is the instructors' responsibility to answer these
questions in a timely manner.

Google Drive
------------

We will use a google drive for collaborative grading and sharing information
among the instructors. This should not be shared outside of the instructors as
it will have FERPA protected information.

Homework
========

Students will turn in approximately 10 homeworks each Monday by 4:10pm (before
class starts). See the course schedule for details. You will be responsible for
collecting, grading, and returning the homeworks.

- Arrange for the homework box before the first day of instruction with the MAE
  office.
- Collect the homework each Monday morning soon after 4:10pm.
- Grade the homework and return the graded homework to Jason in time for him to
  return it the following Monday during class.
- Enter the grades into Canvas by the return date.
- Add a note for Jason the returned homeworks indicating common mistakes and
  whether we need to review them in detail during class.
- You may be asked to prepare homework solutions for new problems or possibly
  even create homework problems.

Computation Projects
====================

You will help develop some computation projects for the students.

Miterm and Final
================

You will co-grade the exams with Jason. We will schedule a time to meet and
grade these together within a week of each exam. Jason will prepare a rubric
and we will each select a portion of the exam to grade.
