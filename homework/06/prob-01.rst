Problem 3.26
   As stated in the book.
Problem 3.32
   Determine the Fourier series as the problem states. Then discuss the effects
   of using fewer or more terms in the infinite series. Finally, plot the
   response of a linear system described by :math:`m=100\textrm{ kg}`,
   :math:`\zeta=0.1`, and :math:`k = 1000\textrm{ N/m}` to the square wave.
   Include the transient and steady state response when
   :math:`x_0=0.1\textrm{m}` and :math:`v_0=0\textrm{m/s}`.
