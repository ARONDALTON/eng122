Problem 4
=========

For a damped system, :math:`m`, :math:`c`, and :math:`k` are known to be
:math:`m = 1 \textrm{kg}`, :math:`c = 2 \textrm{kg/s}`, :math:`k = 10
\textrm{N/m}`. Calculate the values of :math:`\zeta` and :math:`\omega_n`. Is
the system overdamped, underdamped, or critically damped?
