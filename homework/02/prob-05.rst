Problem 5
=========

Using Python in a Jupyter notebook plot :math:`x(t)` for a damped system of
natural frequency :math:`\omega_n = 2 \textrm{rad/s}` and initial conditions
:math:`x_0 = 1 \textrm{mm}`, :math:`v_0 = 0`, for the following values of the
damping ratio: :math:`\zeta = 0.01`, :math:`\zeta = 0.2`, :math:`\zeta = 0.6`,
:math:`\zeta = 0.1`, :math:`\zeta = 0.4`, and :math:`\zeta = 0.8`. Plot each
line in one plot and add a legend for the different values of :math:`\zeta`. In
addition, use the interact_ function to create a slider that allows you to
interactively adjust the values of :math:`\zeta`.
