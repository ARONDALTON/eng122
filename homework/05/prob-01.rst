Problems
========

Complete the following problems in the book:

2.67, 2.68, 2.80, 2.86, 2.97, 3.9, 3.14

Submit your work to Canvas as a Jupyter Notebook (both a PDF of the final
notebook results and the IPYNB notebook file itself). The final equations you
derive should be typed into markdown cells in the notebook. If you want partial
credit for derviations, either type the intermediate steps in the notebook,
include **clear** scans of the paper work in the notebook, or drop a paper copy
of just the derivations into the homework box.
