Software
========

We will be using Python in this class for our computations. Python is a general
purpose high level programming language that has thousands of packages. You
will need to download and install the Anaconda Distribution of Python (Python
3.5 version) from:

https://www.continuum.io/downloads

Anaconda is also available in the CAE lab in Bainer.

Alternatively, you can create Jupyter notebooks using the SageMathCloud_ or
Wakari_ web applications without having to install any software.

Jupyter Notebook Printing and Submission
========================================

When you are finished and ready to print out a Jupyter notebook, make sure
you've done the following:

1. Go to the "Kernel" menu in the notebook and click "Restart & Run All"
2. Once that has completed, check your notebook output cells to make sure there
   aren't any errors
3. Make sure your plots show up in the notebook (add ``%matplotlib notebook``
   somewhere in one of your code cells)

Once you've done that, you can print the notebook by going into the "File" menu
in the notebook and clicking "Print Preview". This should open up a new tab in
your web browser which is just an HTML page. Use your browser's print
functionality to print out the notebook from there. (If you want a PDF, you
should be able to "print to file" instead of selecting a printer from the print
dialog. The details might depend on your computer platform). If you want to
save some paper, printing two-sided and two pages per side is OK.

Finally, submit the "ipynb" file on Canvas having saved the notebook in the
state it is in after following the steps above.
