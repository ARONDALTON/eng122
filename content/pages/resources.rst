Software
========

We will be using Python in this class for our computations. Python is a general
purpose high level programming language that has thousands of packages. You
will need to download and install the Anaconda Distribution of Python (Python
3.5 version) from:

https://www.continuum.io/downloads

Anaconda is also available in the CAE lab in Bainer.

Alternatively, you can create Jupyter notebooks using the SageMathCloud_ or
Wakari_ web applications without having to install any software.

.. _Wakari: https://wakari.io


Jupyter Notebook Submission
===========================

Once you've finished an assignment and you're ready to submit the Jupyter
notebook, make sure you've done the following:

1. Go to the "Kernel" menu in the notebook and click "Restart & Run All"
2. Once that has completed, check your notebook output cells to make sure there
   aren't any errors
3. Make sure your plots show up in the notebook (add ``%matplotlib inline``
   somewhere in one of your code cells)
4. Save the notebook

Once you've done that, you can print the notebook by going into the "File" menu
in the notebook and clicking "Print Preview". This should open up a new tab in
your web browser which is just an HTML page. Use your browser's print
functionality to print and/or save the notebook from there. To obttain a PDF
version of the notebook, you should be able to "print to file" instead of
selecting a printer from the print dialog. The details might depend on your
computer platform.

Finally, submit the "ipynb" and PDF files on Canvas
