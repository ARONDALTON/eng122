Problem 1
=========

Use Langrange's method to solve problem 1.21 in the book.

Problem 2
=========

An undamped system vibrates with a frequency of 10 Hz and amplitude of 1 mm.
Calculate the maximum amplitude of the system's velocity and acceleration.

Problem 3
=========

Using Python inside a Jupyter notebook plot the solutions given by:

.. math::

   x(t) = \frac{\sqrt{\omega_n^2 x_0^2 + v_0^2}}{\omega_n}
     \sin\left(\omega_n t + \arctan\left(\frac{\omega_n x_0}{v_0}\right)\right)

for the case :math:`k = 1000 \textrm{N/m}` and :math:`m = 10 \textrm{kg}` for
two complete periods for each of the following sets of initial conditions: a)
:math:`x_0 = 0`, :math:`v_0= 1 \textrm{m/s}`, b) :math:`x_0= 0.01\textrm{m}`,
:math:`v_0 = 0`, and c) :math:`x_0 = 0.01 \textrm{m}`, :math:`v_0 = 1
\textrm{m/s}`. Plot each result in a sub plot of a single figure.

Problem 4
=========

For a damped system, :math:`m`, :math:`c`, and :math:`k` are known to be
:math:`m = 1 \textrm{kg}`, :math:`c = 2 \textrm{kg/s}`, :math:`k = 10
\textrm{N/m}`. Calculate the values of :math:`\zeta` and :math:`\omega_n`. Is
the system overdamped, underdamped, or critically damped?

Problem 5
=========

Using Python in a Jupyter notebook plot :math:`x(t)` for a damped system of
natural frequency :math:`\omega_n = 2 \textrm{rad/s}` and initial conditions
:math:`x_0 = 1 \textrm{mm}`, :math:`v_0 = 0`, for the following values of the
damping ratio: :math:`\zeta = 0.01`, :math:`\zeta = 0.2`, :math:`\zeta = 0.6`,
:math:`\zeta = 0.1`, :math:`\zeta = 0.4`, and :math:`\zeta = 0.8`. Plot each
line in one plot and add a legend for the different values of :math:`\zeta`. In
addition, use the interact_ function to create a slider that allows you to
interactively adjust the values of :math:`\zeta`.
